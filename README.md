# Conveyor Predictive Wear System

**Conveyor Predictive Wear System** is a full-stack application for real-time conveyor belt wear-and-tear monitoring using **OpenCV (Python)** for computer vision and **React** for a web-based dashboard.  

The system captures conveyor images or video, detects wear patterns, predicts maintenance needs, and provides a visual dashboard for condition tracking. This helps reduce downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve operational efficiency.
